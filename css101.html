<!-- BLOCK ELEMENT (div, p, h1) -->
<!-- 1. A BLOCK level element by default takes up all the space on the line.
2. It can have a height and a width.
3. Nothing can ever be on either side of the block(internal to the parent). EVEN if you change
the width, margin will simply be added. 
4. Default is 100%, it can be > 100% -->

	<!-- INLINE ELEMNT -->
	<!-- 1. Can have stuff on either side
	2. Can NOT have a height or a width. It will ignore both. 
	3. It will respect left and right padding and margin, but will totally ignore top and bottom
	4. Will laugh at you if you try and apply block level rules(few exceptions apply). -->
	

	<!-- INLINE BLOCK -->
	<!-- 1. Can have stuff on either side (just like inline)
	2. Can have height and width (just like block)
	3. Can have top/bottom margin/padding (just like block) -->

		I am inline. I don't really care if you try and set my width or height.
		Seriously, I don't care. I will be as big as I wanna be.
